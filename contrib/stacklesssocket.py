#
# Stackless compatible socket module:
#
# Author: Richard Tew <richard.m.tew@gmail.com>
#
# This code was written to serve as an example of Stackless Python usage.
# Feel free to email me with any questions, comments, or suggestions for
# improvement.
#
# This wraps the asyncore module and the dispatcher class it provides in order
# write a socket module replacement that uses channels to allow calls to it to
# block until a delayed event occurs.
#
# Not all aspects of the socket module are provided by this file.  Examples of
# it in use can be seen at the bottom of this file.
#
# NOTE: Versions of the asyncore module from Python 2.4 or later include bug
#       fixes and earlier versions will not guarantee correct behaviour.
#       Specifically, it monitors for errors on sockets where the version in
#       Python 2.3.3 does not.
#

# Possible improvements:
# - More correct error handling.  When there is an error on a socket found by
#   poll, there is no idea what it actually is.
# - Launching each bit of incoming data in its own tasklet on the recvChannel
#   send is a little over the top.  It should be possible to add it to the
#   rest of the queued data
