# Stackless compatible socket module.

# improvement.
#
# Remaining work:
#
# = Asyncore does not add that much to this module.  In fact, its
#   limitations and differences between implementations in different Python
#   versions just complicate things.
# = Select on Windows only handles 512 sockets at a time.  So if there
#   are more sockets than that, then they need to be separated and
#   batched around this limitation.
# = It should be possible to have this wrap different mechanisms of
#   asynchronous IO, from select to IO completion ports.
# = UDP support is mostly there due to the new hands off approach, but
#   there are a few spots like handle_write and timeout handling, which need
#   to be dealt with.
#
# Python standard library socket unit test state:
#
# - 2.5: Bad.
# - 2.6: Excellent (two UDP failures).
# - 2.7: Excellent (two UDP failures).
#
# This module is otherwise known to generally work for 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7.
#
# Small parts of this code were contributed back with permission from an
# internal version of this module in use at CCP Games.

# If you pump the scheduler and wish to prevent the scheduler from staying
# non-empty for prolonged periods of time, If you do not pump the scheduler,
# you may however wish to prevent calls to poll() from running too long.
# Doing so gives all managed sockets a fairer chance at being read from,
# rather than paying prolonged attention to sockets with more incoming data.
#
# These values govern how long a poll() call spends at a given attempt
# of reading the data present on a given socket.

            This will be called once per-poll call per socket with data in its buffer to be read.
            
            If you call poll once every 30th of a second, then you are going to be rate limited
            in terms of how fast you can read incoming data by the packet size they arrive in.
            In order to deal with the worst case scenario, advantage is taken of how scheduling
            works in order to keep reading until there is no more data left to read.
            
            1.  This function is called indicating data is present to read.
            2.  The desired amount is read and a send call is made on the channel with it.
            3.  The function is blocked on that action and the tasklet it is running in is reinserted into the scheduler.
            4.  The tasklet that made the read related socket call is awakened with the given data.
            5.  It returns the data to the function that made that call.
            6.  The function that made the call makes another read related socket call.
                a) If the call is similar enough to the last call, then the previous channel is retrieved.
                b) Otherwise, a new channel is created.
            7.  The tasklet that is making the read related socket call is blocked on the channel.
            8.  This tasklet that was blocked sending gets scheduled again.
                a) If there is a tasklet blocked on the channel that it was using, then goto 2.
                b) Otherwise, the function exits.

            Note that if this function loops indefinitely, and the scheduler is pumped rather than
            continuously run, the pumping application will stay in its pump call for a prolonged
            period of time potentially starving the rest of the application for CPU time.
            
            An attempt is made in _recv to limit the amount of data read in this manner to a fixed
            amount and it lets this function exit if that amount is exceeded.  However, this it is
            up to the user of Stackless to understand how their application schedules and blocks,
            and there are situations where small reads may still effectively loop indefinitely.
