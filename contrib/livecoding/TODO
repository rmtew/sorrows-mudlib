- Documentation.

Need to flesh out the README file.
Need to update the wiki.

- The 'livecoding' library.

Should have a clearer distinction between automatic and user driven updates.

  Which gives the following two categories:

  - Automatic updating (have to be using threads).
  - User driven updates.
 
  The user can also choose how updates are detected.
 
  - Inline when polling.
  - Accrued in a thread.  These would be acquired from a queue.

  This is still quite confused.  But it would all be hidden away in filechanges.

- The 'filechanges' library.

Only the continually polling method works.  The other two are either not ready
or require work to solve problems which make them unsuitable for use.
