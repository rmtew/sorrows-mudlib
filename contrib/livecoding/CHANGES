==========

Version 2.01
------------

* Scripts are now read in universal line ending mode before being executed.  This prevents SyntaxErrors from happening on platforms other than Windows when scripts being read contain \r\n line endings.
* Adjusted the unit tests to handle the fact that file modification timestamps are limited to a per-second resolution on Linux-like platforms.  The tests were passing on Windows because it has a higher resolution for these timestamps.
