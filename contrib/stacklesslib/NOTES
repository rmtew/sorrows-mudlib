#   - Entries in the event queue are abstracted away behind a wakeup function
#     so it is not possible enumerate all the blocked tasklets directly.
#
#   - Tasklets are created via stackless.tasklet(), might be a good idea to
#     provide a centralised location through which tasklets can be created.
#     Perhaps also allow a tasklet class to be registered.
#     - Top level exception catching in tasklets to prevent them from being
#       raised out.
