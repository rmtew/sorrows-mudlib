This should build a terrain.pyd python module.

It relies on the existance of the include and libs directories in:
c:/program files/python23/
So, you will need to change this for both of these cases if
you do not use the same path.

Remember that we use stackless and that the python23.lib it
looks for should be the stackless version.  I guess.  Not
sure it it matters :)
