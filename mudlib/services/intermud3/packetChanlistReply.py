#channel_list is mapping with channel names as keys, and an array of two elements as the values. If the value is 0, then the channel has been deleted. The array contains the host mud, and the type of the channel:
#        0  selectively banned
#        1  selectively admitted
#        2  filtered (selectively admitted)
