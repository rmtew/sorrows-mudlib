<P>
While in a perfect world, Intermud would be open for everyone
to use as they please, this is not a perfect world. The public availability of 
mudlibs that require little or no intelligence on the part of any potential
administrator means that any immature creators can alter the intermud client
that comes with their mudlib to take advantage of loopholes that the router
does not cover.  Throw in those that write their own clients and its a nuisance
for all the other people that just want to use Intermud for what it was
created for.  This is why conditions of use are needed; so that there are rules
laid down in clear terms so that those who might otherwise act in ways that
annoy others can be held to task.

<P>
If the need arises to make a complaint, please contact
Deathblade (Greg Stein, <A HREF="mailto:gstein@lyra.org">gstein@lyra.org</A>).
</P>

<P>
There are four decision makers involved in the application of the policy:
<UL><LI>
Descartes (George Reese, <A HREF="mailto:borg@imaginary.com">borg@imaginary.com</A>)
</LI><LI>
Rust (John Viega, <A HREF="mailto:rust@virginia.edu">rust@virginia.edu</A>)
</LI><LI>
Beek (Tim Hollebeek, <A HREF="mailto:beek@imaginary.com">beek@imaginary.com</A>)
</LI><LI>
Zakk (?, <A HREF="mailto:???@???.???">???@???.???</A>)
</LI></UL>
</P>

<P>Anyway, here are the conditions all users must adhere to:</P>

<OL>
<LI><B>Users should not be misrepresented in packets sent to the router.</B>
<P>
This would have to be the most common abuse performed by immature Intermud
users.  The simplest infringement of this would be to fill the
<A HREF="???">originator username</A> field of the basic Intermud packet with
a username other than that of the user who caused the packet to be sent.
</P><P>
e.g. Foofoo has his muds Intermud client set up to send all his tell messages
as if they were from Spamspanker.
</P></LI>

<LI><B>Thou shalt not spam.</B>
<P>
Spam is not allowed: on the channels, or with non-channel traffic
directed at one or more muds.  Spam is defined as overly large packets
and/or numerous packets being issued repeatedly.
</P></LI>

<LI><B>Don't crap on the router.</B>
<P>
Escape sequences, ascii art, control characters, etc. are not allowed in
channel messages, tells, emotes, etc. Basically, all strings placed into
the packets should be "printable" characters from the Latin-1 character
set.
</P></LI>

<LI><B>Can't we all be fwiends?</B>
<P>
While the "7 dirty words" are usually tolerated, "hate speech"
absolutely is not. it is the quickest and most absolute way towards a
ban.
</P></LI>

<LI><B>Every mud must supply a valid contact e-mail address.</B>
<P>
Occasions arise where it is necessary to contact a mud that is connected
to the Intermud-3 network.  This may be because a given muds client incorrectly
supports the Intermud-3 protocol, because the intermud router is moving and
the administrators of each mud need to be notified, because the Intermud-3
personnel wish to notify a mud administrator about problem users on their
mud, or for any number of possible reasons.  If a valid address is not given
then that mud may be denied connection to the Intermud-3 network.
