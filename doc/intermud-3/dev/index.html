    <h1>I3 Router Development Info</h1>

    <p>
      <font color=red><b>This is a private page for the I3 Router Dev
          Team. Do not publicize.</b></font>
    </p>

    <p>
      Until we get some better ideas of what is needed, this page will
      be relatively barren. Suggestions welcome...
    </p>

    <p>TODO list</p>
    <ul>
      <li>V4 protocol (see below)</li>
      <li>multi-router</li>
      <li>find ways to get people to upgrade so we can drop V1..V3
        support</li>
      <li>timeout connections that don't send a startup-req</li>
      <li>
        block "bad" IPs before too much processing occurs. where "bad"
        is defined as banned or currently-spamming IPs.
      </li>
      <li>review I3 emails to collect features/concerns/etc</li>
      <li>work on the www.intermud.org web site</li>
      <li>
        revise protocol spec: core specification plus OOB specs. The
        OOB specs are simply layered on top of the core spec.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>V4 Protocol items</p>
    <ul>
      <li>partial mudlists and chanlists on startup</li>
      <li>enforcement of passwords</li>
      <li>There are also channel queries to add.</li>
      <li>I'd also like to revamp OOB (make it unidirectional)</li>
      <li>
        toss out news altogether. (the current news spec is a
        partially-completed abomination by Rust and should have been
        tossed or completed long ago).
        <p>
          Johan says:<br>

          There have been a few nice suggestions for a
          better news spec., but I doubt if this would be used much
          even when it is implemented... Hmmm well, we can add it
          anyway: as this is OOB traffic, it won't compromise the
          router. Then just let the MUDs decide whether they like to
          implement this. (I can imagine this being used for
          mudlib/driver development.)
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        V4 would also be hard-nosed about filtering based on the services
        list.
      </li>
      <li>
        We also want to spec two new services: no-spoof, and "www":
        base_url.
        <br>
        Probably some more, IIRC other services have been
        suggested along the road.
      </li>
      <li>
        admin_email requirements for one: format, valid domain name
      </li>
      <li>come up with a spec for the V4 changes</li>
      <li>put router hostnames into the startup-reply</li>
      <li>add ping (with appropriate limiter)</li>
    </ul>
