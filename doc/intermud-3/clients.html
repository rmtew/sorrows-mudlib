<A href="http://sorrows.imaginary.com/">Nameless Sorrows</A> have made
available a package containing the Intermud-3
client from their mudlib, this can be found <A
href="http://sorrows.imaginary.com/validate.html">here</A>.
</LI>
<P>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://lima.imaginary.com/">Lima Mudlib</A> contains
an implementation of the Intermud-3 system (written by Greg Stein).  This
was the first implementation to exist and is one of the few that is readily and publically available for use by other systems.  It was implemented for the MudOS v22 driver.
It is publically available at:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/lib/LIMA/">ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/lib/LIMA/</A>
<P>
<LI>
The <A HREF="http://www.imaginary.com/LPC/Nightmare/">Nightmare Object Library</A>
also contains an implementation of the Intermud-3 system (written by George Reese).  This implementation is also one of the oldest around, originating soon after the Lima version and first appearing in the release of Nightmare IV (<I>No longer available</I>).
<P>
The Intermud-3 system for Nightmare (and Foundation) has also been pulled
out into its own package, available at:
<A
HREF="ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/etc/i3.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/etc/i3.tar.gz</A>.
<P>
<LI>Terry (Terry Penn, <A HREF="mailto:aurora@openix.com">aurora@openix.com</A>) has
created two implementations of the Intermud-3 system.
<UL>
<LI> One is for Shadow's Edge running LPMUD 3.2.1@122
<LI> Another for MudOS v22a18
</UL>
Both of these are running on custom mudlibs and are not generally available.
</LI>

<P><LI>
There appears to be an Intermud-3 client written for the Amylaar LPmud driver available
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/etc/amylaar-intermud3.tar.gz">ftp://ftp.imaginary.com/pub/LPC/etc/amylaar-intermud3.tar.gz</A>.
