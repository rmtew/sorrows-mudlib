This directory contains the documentation for the Sorrows mudlib.

Note that the documentation is written in the restructured text format.
If you wish to read it as web pages, rather than in this marked up form,
then you will either need to acquire a prebuilt version, or build your
own.

To generate the HTML documentation on Windows:

  Install sphinx from http://sphinx.pocoo.org
  Run build.bat

To generate the HTML documentation on other platforms, open build.bat and run
the commands manually, modifying the locations and paths to suit your platform.
