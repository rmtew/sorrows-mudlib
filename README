======================= SORROWS MUDLIB =======================

This is the third version of the Sorrows mudlib.  The first was a modified
version of the Discworld LP mudlib.  The second was a version of the original
mudlib rewritten from the ground up (still including parts of the Discworld
mudlib, but much cleaner).  This is the currect implementation.

It was originally written for a mud called Nameless Sorrows.

-- GETTING STARTED -------------------------------------------

In order to run this, it should be sufficient to have installed:

	Python 2.6.4
		http://www.python.org
	Stackless Python dll and lib replacements for Python 2.5.2
		http://www.stackless.com

Running this for the first time:

	1. Copy "config.ini.base" to "config.ini"
	2. Edit "config.ini" and modify the relevant lines.

	   If you are running it with an active internet connection then
	   making sure you have a unique mud name might be a good idea
	   given the default intermud3 running behaviour.

Open a console in this directory and type:

	python bootstrap.py
	
Or if python is not in your path, something like:

	"PATH TO PYTHON\python" bootstrap.py
	e.g. "c:\python26\python.exe" bootstrap.py

Then, given a successful start-up, you should see something like:

    D:\SVN\_personal\sorrows\trunk>c:\Python26\python.exe bootstrap.py

    2010-01-21 15:24:44;net;INFO;Listening on address :3000

The next step is to log in.

    Start -> Run (presuming you are using Windows)
    telnet localhost 3000

Now you should have a telnet window in which you are greeted by
output from the MUD server.  Enter a name and a password to get
to the command prompt:

    Nameless Sorrows
    Enter 'quit' or 'q' at any time during the login process to disconnect.

    Login name: richard
    Creating a new account with the name 'richard'.
    Password:
    Password (again):
    You are logged in as "richard".
    >

To shutdown the MUD server, you can either enter 'shutdown' at the
telnet command prompt or you can press control-c in the MUD server
console window.

-- DEVELOPERS VS. PLAYERS ------------------------------------

Any user who logs into the MUD will be logged in as a player.  But users
can also log in as developers if the appropriate preparations are taken.

The position of developer is one with a set level of access.  All users
who have been made developers, have that same level of access.  It is
not intended to be given to anyone you do not trust, as it includes access
to commands that allow execution of Python code.

In order to accord a user the status of being a developer, the MUD must
be shut down and the 'config.ini' file should be edited.  A section by
the name of 'developers' should be added, if it is not already present.
And in that section, the names of users who are to be developers should
be listed in the following manner.

[developers]
richard = 1
