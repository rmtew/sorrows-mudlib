======================= SORROWS MUDLIB =======================

This is the third version of the Sorrows mudlib.  The first was a modified
version of the Discworld LP mudlib.  The second was a version of the original
mudlib rewritten from the ground up (still including parts of the Discworld
mudlib, but much cleaner).  This is the currect implementation.

It was originally written for a mud called Nameless Sorrows.

-- QUICK ADDITIONS -------------------------------------------

The Intermud service is not fully working and needs some fixes still.

The OpenCyc suuport sill requires fixes.

-- GETTING STARTED -------------------------------------------

In order to run this, it should be sufficient to have installed:

	Python 2.5.2
		http://www.python.org
	Stackless Python dll and lib replacements for Python 2.5.2
		http://www.stackless.com

Running this for the first time:

	1. Copy "config.ini.base" to "config.ini"
	2. Edit "config.ini" and modify the relevant lines.

	   If you are running it with an active internet connection then
	   making sure you have a unique mud name might be a good idea
	   given the default intermud3 running behaviour.

Open a console in this directory and type:

	python bootstrap.py
	
Or if python is not in your path, something like:

	"PATH TO PYTHON\python" bootstrap.py
	e.g. "c:\program files\python23\python" bootstrap.py

Then, given a successful start-up, you should see something like:

    D:\SVN\_personal\sorrows\trunk>c:\Python25\python.exe bootstrap.py
    STARTING sorrows.services
    Starting sorrows.net
    Starting sorrows.rules
    Starting sorrows.commands
    Starting sorrows.data
    Starting sorrows.users
    Starting sorrows.world
    Starting sorrows.worldVoid
    Starting sorrows.worldMap2D
    WorldMap2D: Read map "map.txt", 40x40
    Starting sorrows.entity2
    Starting sorrows.entityVoid
    (held off 2 starts due to dependencies in the process, tries left 20 )
    STARTED sorrows.services

The next step is to log in.

    Start -> Run (presuming you are using Windows)
    telnet localhost 3000

Now you should have a telnet window in which you are greeted by
output from the MUD server.  Enter a name and a password to get
to the command prompt:

    Nameless Sorrows 4.0
    Enter 'quit' or 'q' at any time during the login process to disconnect.
    
    Login name: richard
    Creating a new account with the name 'richard'.
    Password: <censored>
    Password (again): <censored>
    You are logged in as "richard".
    > commands
    Available commands:
      shutdown
      rehash
      commands
      e
      look
      exec
      python
      l
      who
      sw
      ne
      n
      start
      s
      cheight
      w
      world
      say
      se
      nw
    >

To shutdown the MUD server, you can either enter 'shutdown' at the
telnet command prompt or you can press control-c in the MUD server
console window.

See doc/PASTE-SCRIPTS for some additional information.

-- EXPERIMENTAL ----------------------------------------------

Simulation:

    There is a simple simulation involving a baker, a miller
    and a farmer.  This is based in the world model provided
    by the 'worldVoid' service which is an infinite 2D void.
    To get this working paste the contents of the PASTE-SCRIPTS
    file in the telnet window after you have logged in with a
    user name and password.  But note that the simulation
    output is written to the server console window, not the
    telnet window.

Inference engine:

    The Python bindings to the OpenCyc inference engine are
    included in the source code and are linked into the MUD
    server.  If a version of the OpenCyc engine is running
    on the local host, it will be connected to and can be
    used if you know what you are doing.

-- LOST AND FOUND  -------------------------------------------

The original world model gave the player a ANSI coloured view
of a 2D map from some included text files.  However, some of
the files have gone missing breaking this world model which
is (was) provided by the 'worldMap2D' service.
