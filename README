======================= SORROWS MUDLIB =======================

This is the third version of the Sorrows mudlib.  The first was a modified
version of the Discworld LP mudlib.  The second was a version of the original
mudlib rewritten from the ground up (still including parts of the Discworld
mudlib, but much cleaner).  This is the currect implementation.

It was originally written for a mud called Nameless Sorrows.

-- GETTING STARTED -------------------------------------------

In order to run this, it should be sufficient to have installed:

	Python 2.6.4
		http://www.python.org
	Stackless Python dll and lib replacements for Python 2.5.2
		http://www.stackless.com

Running this for the first time:

	1. Copy "config.ini.base" to "config.ini"
	2. Edit "config.ini" and modify the relevant lines.

	   If you are running it with an active internet connection then
	   making sure you have a unique mud name might be a good idea
	   given the default intermud3 running behaviour.

Open a console in this directory and type:

	python bootstrap.py
	
Or if python is not in your path, something like:

	"PATH TO PYTHON\python" bootstrap.py
	e.g. "c:\python26\python.exe" bootstrap.py

Then, given a successful start-up, you should see something like:

    D:\SVN\_personal\sorrows\trunk>c:\Python26\python.exe bootstrap.py

    2010-01-21 15:24:44;net;INFO;Listening on address :3000

The next step is to log in.

    Start -> Run (presuming you are using Windows)
    telnet localhost 3000

Now you should have a telnet window in which you are greeted by
output from the MUD server.  Enter a name and a password to get
to the command prompt:

    Nameless Sorrows
    Enter 'quit' or 'q' at any time during the login process to disconnect.

    Login name: richard
    Creating a new account with the name 'richard'.
    Password:
    Password (again):
    You are logged in as "richard".
    >

To shutdown the MUD server, you can either enter 'shutdown' at the
telnet command prompt or you can press control-c in the MUD server
console window.
